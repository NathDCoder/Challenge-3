Homework Assignment 
-------------------------------------------------------
This is my code for a Password Generator that allows the user to 
generate a password of their choice based on the options they choose.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. The first thing I did was create an array of strings consisting of Lowercase, Uppercase,
numbers, and Special characters. I seperated each catergory because I knew that the User would need 
a choice of whether they wanted to include a catergory or not.

2. Next I created variables that would go into if statements, so that once a catergory was chosen the 
computer would either read it as true or false. Each variable would have a comfirm prompt, and then the true or 
false statements would follow. I also created alerts in the if' statements incase the user puts nothing or 
if it doesn't meet password length requirements. Each confirm statement is attached to a variable called 
passwordOptions of the different catergories and then a return statment that would return a password at random.

3.Next I created the Math.Random formula and the function generatePassword. I punched in the values into each if statement 
for the all the options available and used .push to push them into the newly generated password.

4. All the other elements that attached the newly generated password to the page were provided.
